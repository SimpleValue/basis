# basis

We are the creators of [Storrito](https://storrito.com/) and
[Audiocado](https://audiocado.com/). And we plan to create even more
Software-as-a-Service projects in the future.

Storrito and Audiocado have quite a lot of code in common. This
repository here tries to capture the ideas and the code which have
proven itself in production. This effort just has been started and
there is not much to see yet. But over time we will create a solid
`basis` for all of our SaaS projects.

The basis project will be structured as mono-repo and will define one
holistic approach how to build a SaaS system. Everything more general
will reside in libraries outside of this project. basis will be
something between a library and a full-blown framework.
